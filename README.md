# PHP Core Framework

This is a lightweight PHP framework developed by me (phanvan91), intended for fast prototyping, educational purposes, or small-to-medium web applications.

## 📦 Repository

You can clone the framework from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/phanvan91/php_core
```

## ⚙️ Environment Requirements

- PHP version >= 8.0
- Composer (dependency manager for PHP)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies and regenerate autoload files:
    ```
    composer dump-autoload
    ```

2. Start the local development server:
    ```
    php core-cli serve
    ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🧪 Notes
